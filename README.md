## Salvete!

This silly little project is meant to be used for training your Latin vocabulary.

The ID of a Google data sheet and a valid Google API key must be given in an env var in a `.env.local` file

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=<your_id>
```

Install the dependencies with

```
npm install
```

and run the dev server with

```
npm run dev
```

Since this is a Next.js (app dir) application, it's easily deployable to Vercel.
