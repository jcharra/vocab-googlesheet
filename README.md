## Salvete!

This silly little project is meant to be used for training your Latin vocabulary.

The ID of the Google data sheet is given in an env var

GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=<your_id>

in a `.env.local` file.

After installing the dependencies with

```
npm install
```

you can run the dev server with

```
npm run dev
```

Since this is a Next.js (app dir) application, it's easily deployable to Vercel.
